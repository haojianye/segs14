\title{Adaptive Defending Strategy for Smart Grid Attacks}

% There's nothing stopping you putting the seventh, eighth, etc.
% author on the opening page (as the 'third row') but we ask,
% for aesthetic reasons that you place these 'additional authors'
% in the \additional authors block, viz.

% Just remember to make sure that the TOTAL number of authors
% is the number that will appear on the first page PLUS the
% number that will appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\input{problem}

%describe the game-theoretic modeling of the defender-attacker model (refer to \cite{ma2013markov}). The difference is that we assume that each time the attacker launchs an attack on the system and the system's performance is degraded due to the attack, the system will be restored to its initial state before the next attack occurs (any damaged transimission link will be repaired). In this way, the origianl markov game model can be reduced to the repeated game model- markov game with only one state.
